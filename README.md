<b>.::WHO AM I::.</b> <br/>
Hi at ALL! <br/>
My name is Frenz and i'm an italian boy which is in a continous and constant growing in web developing (: <br/>
As the most of You I guess. <br/>
Unfortunately, web is not (yet) my job, actually I'm an electronic technicial but web and technology are my passions.<br/>
Nowadays, i'm working on myself and improving my skills, so there are not big projects or works, just trying to create my<br/> 
portfolio on my own :)<br/>
Hoping to make a good work and be soon a functional part of this community!<br/>
I would like to work as a #frontend developer, my dream is working in a little startup with the possibility to create my own career and grow<br>
with my company :)<br>
Feel free to contact me for any stuffs! </br>
